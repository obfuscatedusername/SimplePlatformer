Unity / C# | A simple 2D platforming game, built as a proof of concept for a unit on Game Development currently teach.

The game is all on one screen, the goal is to pick up the key and then make your way to the end of the level whilst avoiding the traps! Controls are simple, A & D for movement direction and Space bar for jumping (you can also double jump), the player can be reset to the start with R and the entire game reloaded (to reset timer and death count) with T.

Repo contains all project files and assets, and a built version of the game. The build should be run with highest graphics settings as low settings seems to upset the physics.

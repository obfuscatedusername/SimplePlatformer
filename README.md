# SimplePlatformer
Unity / C# | A simple 2D platforming game, built as a proof of concept for a unit on Game Development currently teach.

The game is all on one screen, and features a number of traps. The goal is to pick up the key and then make your way to the end of the level. Controls are simple, A & D for movement direction and Space bar for jumping (you can also double jump). 

Repo contains all project files and assets, and a built version of the game. The build should be run with highest graphics settings as low settings seems to upset the physics.
